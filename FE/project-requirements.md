You can create a new website like Unsplash but with your style
A website contains a menu bar at the top. On the home page, we can see random photos. We can click on each item in the
menu to navigate to the page we want to see. Each item is a topic, whatever you want. E.g.: flowers, buildings, sports, etc.
Able to click on the image to see the details.
We provided the API above. You can access the document page to read details and use it to fetch photos.
A side bar contains the features of web. The menu contains search and category of images (Like the original unsplash website)
